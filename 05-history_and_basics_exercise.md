## Exercise
Participants are split into two or more groups.  
  
Group members should discuss:
- How they have relied on cryptography during the day (brainstorming) 
- What cryptographic tools/technologies/software they are familiar with/have knowingly used
- What areas they are most interested in learning about
  
After presentation, send notes to
**[courses+crypto_010501@%EMAIL_DOMAIN%](mailto:courses+crypto_010501@%EMAIL_DOMAIN%)**
