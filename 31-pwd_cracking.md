Passwords -
can't live with 'em, can't live without em -
am I right?

In this course, we'll focus on offline cracking.

### It's all about the hashes
Passwords are typically stored using
one-way hash functions.  
  
Keys for symmetric encryption are typically generated by a KDF (basically a hash function).  
  
Asymmetric private keys are often stored using symmetric cryptography.

### Linux / UNIX password storage
Historically, "**/etc/passwd**" used to contain the
(weakly) hashed passwords for users on a system.  
  
These days salted and hashed passwords are
stored in "**/etc/shadow**".

Many applications store passwords in similar ways, often in a SQL database.

## Widows password storage
Credentials for local and "cached" users are
stored in the "SAM database".  
  
Also loves storing credentials for authenticated users in memory.

# What the hash?!
### LM or NTLM/NTHash

## LM "hash"
Window's legacy method for storing passwords.  
  
Disabled by default in Windows Vista,
but still lingers around.
  
Why replace it, you may ask?

<!-- _footer: "%ATTRIBUTION_PREFIX% William Warby (CC BY 2.0)" -->
## LM "hash"
1. Convert all lower case to upper case
2. Pad password to 14 characters with NULL characters
3. Split the password to two 7 character chunks
4. Create two DES keys from each 7 character chunk
5. DES encrypt the string "KGS!@#$%" with these two chunks
6. Concatenate the two DES encrypted strings.

## NTLM/NTHash
Current method used to store passwords.

The secret sauce?

```
md4(password)
```

**How does "password/hash cracking work?** 
  
1. Calculate hash for password candidate
2. Compare computed hash with stored hash
3. If equal, you've likely found the password, if not repeat with new candidate.

When you say "fast", what does that mean?  
  
Well, let's run a test with a [RTX 4090](https://www.prisjakt.nu/c/grafikkort?532=39780):

```
$ hashcat --benchmark-all
```

For [~2$/per hour you can get a "g5.12xlarge"](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/spot/pricing/)
which cracks 368 GH/s of NTLM/NTHash.

Can we make it go even faster?  
  
FPGAs and ASICs to the rescue!

Our only option isn't just to throw compute at the problem.  
  
We can crack smarter.
