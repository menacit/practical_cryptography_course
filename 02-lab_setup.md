**You'll need a [YubiKey 5](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) for
some of the non-graded exercises.**

<!--
- For labs and experiments, students will need a Yubikey

- Thankfully, Yubico has provided them to the in-class students

- A nimble device that can be used to increase cryptographic security, more about it later!

To install/configure tools required for the
course labs, several options are available:

1. Native setup:<br>Recommended for students running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on a physical/virtual machine
2. Non-native setup:<br>Recommend for students running Windows/MacOS on their physical machine
3. Manual setup:<br>Available for students running other Linux distributions/operating systems

See ["resources/labs/README.md"](%RESOURCES_ARCHIVE%) for details!

<!--
- We'll need some software and a lab environments for the course

- For now, just make sure that the software is installed and seem to be working.

- Check out the presentation links: I will however not provide a step-by-step guide, you won't get
it in real life.

- Have a look at the README.md, contains several tips for solving common issues
