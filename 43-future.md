We cannot (yet) foresee the future.  
  
Let's talk about some trends and
insights into what may be next.

## Post-quantum cryptography 
Theoretically possible to efficiently break
**asymmetric** encryption/signing.  
  
Hard to know ~~exactly~~ how close we are,
but sunsetting cryptography solutions
takes plenty of time.  
 
Work-around is to wrap asymmetric ciphers
in symmetric encryption like AES, 
but not always a good option.

## Post-quantum cryptography 
**NIST** and other actors are working on
new publicly-audited standards
for quantum-resistant ciphers.  

"**CRYSTALS-Kyber**" (encryption) and
"**CRYSTALS-Dilithium**" (signing)
are currently being implemented in
cryptography libraries/toolkits.  

Most solutions opt to use them
in unison with "traditional ciphers".

## Open implementations
Publicly available cryptography standards
have been the norm for a long time.  
  
Moving towards demand for
open/publicly auditable implementations.  
  
Affects both software and hardware.

## Post-hype technologies
Cryptocurrencies, web3, NFTs and
other blockchain technologies use
lots of very interesting cryptography.  
  
Starting to slowly and sensibly be
cherry-picked into other solutions.

## Law and order
Fewer attempts to restrict
usage of cryptography.  
  
Focus on jurisdiction to enable
lawful interception through
endpoint backdoors and CSS.  

Targeting "crime-supporting" functions,
like cryptocurrency exchanges/tumblers.
