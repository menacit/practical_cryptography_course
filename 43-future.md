We cannot (yet) foresee the future.  
  
Let's talk about some trends and insights into what may be next.

## Post-quantum cryptography 
Theoretically possible to efficiently break
**asymmetric** encryption/signing.  
  
Hard to know how close we are, but sunsetting cryptography solutions take time.  
  
**NIST** and other actors are working on new publicly-audited standards for quantum-resistance.  
  
Work-around is to wrap asymmetric with symmetric.

## Open implementations
Public cryptography standards have been the norm for a long time.  
  
Moving towards demand for open/publicly auditable implementations.  
  
Affects both software and hardware.

## Post-hype technologies
Cryptocurrencies, web3 and other blockchain technologies use lots of interesting cryptography.  
  
Starting to slowly and sensibly be cherrypicked into other solutions.

## Law and order
Fewer attempts to restrict usage of cryptography.  
  
Focus on jurisdiction to enable lawful interception through endpoint backdoors and CSS.
