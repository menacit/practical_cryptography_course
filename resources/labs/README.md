# Practical cryptography course - Labs

## Setup

### Automated setup
In order to get started with the course labs, the following software components must be installed
on the user's host computer:

- [HashiCorp Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads)
- [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Connect YubiKey via USB, open a command prompt in ["resources/labs"](%RESOURCES_ARCHIVE%) and run:

```
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ vagrant ssh -- ykman info
```


## Manual setup
Users who, for whatever reason, can't/prefer not to use Vagrant and/or VirtualBox may opt for
manual setup of the lab system. This can be done on a physical or virtual machine, provided that:

- It runs Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or a compatible derivative
- Supports attaching/forwarding USB devices

For manual setup, install [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and run the Ansible playbook
"resources/labs/setup\_lab\_system.yml" against the target system.


## Common issues

### "Incompatible character encodings"
Vagrant doesn't handle file system paths well with non-ASCII character/mixed character encoding.  
Users who encounter error messages such as "join: incompatible character encodings: CP850 and..."
have two options: create a new user account/file system path containing only ASCII characters (A-Z)
or reconfigure the Vagrant path settings, as documented below.  
  
On Windows, start a command prompt **as administrator** (right click "Run as administrator") and
execute the following commands:

```
$ md "C:\vagrant_data"
$ setx VAGRANT_HOME "C:/vagrant_data"
$ setx GEM_HOME "C:/vagrant_data"
$ takeown /a /r /f "C:\vagrant_data"
$ "C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox\VBoxManage.exe" setproperty machinefolder "C:\vagrant_data"
```

Copy the "resources" directory into "C:\\vagrant\_data" and re-execute "vagrant up".


### USB forwarding on Linux
Linux users who encounter problems accessing their YubiKey inside a VirtualBox may not have the
appropriate privileges configured. A requirement to utilize the "USB forwarding" functionality
is to be a member of the "vboxusers" group - if this is not the case, execute the command below
and reboot the host system:

```
$ sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers "${USER}"
```
