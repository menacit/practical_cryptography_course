## Exercise: Let's warm up!
Participants are split into two or more groups.  
  
Group members should discuss:

- What cryptographic tools/technologies/software they are already familiar with
- What areas/use-cases they are most interested in learning about
- What has been good/bad with the previous course and what would they like to change
  
After presentation, send notes to
**[courses+crypto_010501@%EMAIL_DOMAIN%](mailto:courses+crypto_010501@%EMAIL_DOMAIN%)**
